## Briefly About Myself 

After graduating from university in 2013, I have worked in the field of road construction for 8 years. The main focus was geodesy.
During this time, I deeply studied the practical application of high-precision measuring instruments. Operation of GPS navigation devices in construction. He was also closely associated with 3D modeling programs for linear structures.
Constantly working with numbers motivated me to automate all processes for greater productivity.
However, when faced with problems that cannot be solved in Excel, I began to think about learning programming.

Even at school, my main subjects were mathematics and programming. Therefore, I easily manage to build logical chains to solve various problems.

Work in a construction organization taught me teamwork, and the position of a surveyor also taught me responsibility for the quality and correctness of work, because it is the study of working documentation and its implementation in life is my main task.
Now I want to learn how to pave roads and make other people's lives better, not only in real life, but also in digital
